# Welcome to ChatterEngine

This project is my attempt to learn how to build my own **Speech-to-Speech Translation Engine**.

### Model Use Case  
The goal is to develop a **speech-to-speech translation system** with an additional text output feature.

## 🛠️ Process Overview  
**Speech Recognition** → **Translation** → **Translated Speech Output**  

This project will combine **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**, **natural language translation**, and **text-to-speech synthesis** to create a seamless translation system.  

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
